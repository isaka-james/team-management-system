## Author Comment
I got the inspiration from a random guy on youtube, and decided to make a system like that from scratch, now here we go!

## Functionalities
  - User inputs the names of the people who are supposed to divided into teams by the system,
  - User inputs the number of which each team should have,
  - The system generates the teams randomly, based on the information fed.
